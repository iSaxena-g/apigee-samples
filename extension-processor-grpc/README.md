# Cloud Run gRPC Backend with Global HTTPS Load Balancer

This script automates the deployment of a gRPC backend service to Google Cloud Run and configures a Global External HTTPS Load Balancer to route traffic to it. It includes the creation of a global static IP address and a Google-managed SSL certificate for secure communication.

The solution leverages a Serverless Network Endpoint Group (NEG) to seamlessly integrate Cloud Run with the Load Balancer.

**Important:** This setup uses `nip.io` for the custom domain and SSL certificate, which is suitable for testing and development. For production environments, you should replace this with a real custom domain that you own and manage.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI):** Installed and authenticated.
    * `gcloud auth login`
    * `gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
2.  **`git`:** Installed for cloning the gRPC example repository.
3.  **`jq` (Optional):** A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. While not strictly required by the script's current logic, it's a useful tool for inspecting `gcloud` outputs.
4.  **Google Cloud Project:** An active Google Cloud project with billing enabled.
5.  **APIs Enabled:** Ensure the following APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project:
    * Cloud Run Admin API
    * Compute Engine API
    * Cloud Load Balancing API

## Setup and Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables at the beginning of the script. You can either modify the script directly or export these variables in your shell session before running the script.

### Required Environment Variables (Exports)

You **must** set the following variables:

* `PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud Project ID where the resources will be deployed.
    * **Example:** `export PROJECT_ID="my-grpc-project-12345"`
* `REGION`: The Google Cloud region for deploying the Cloud Run service and the Serverless NEG. This should be a region where Cloud Run is available.
    * **Example:** `export REGION="us-central1"`
* `SERVICENAME`: The desired name for your Cloud Run service. This name will be used consistently across all created resources.
    * **Example:** `export SERVICENAME="my-grpc-app"`
* `pythonfilename`: The name of the main Python server file within the `grpc-backend/examples/python/helloworld` directory that your Cloud Run service should execute.
    * **Example:** `export pythonfilename="greeter_server.py"`
* `SA_NAME`: The name of a Service Account you want to use for `gcloud` impersonation for certain commands (specifically, for creating the global static IP). This service account **must exist** and have the necessary permissions (see [Service Account Impersonation](#service-account-impersonation)).
    * **Example:** `export SA_NAME="my-impersonation-sa"`
* `CUSTOM_AUDIENCE`: (Currently unused due to `--allow-unauthenticated`) This variable is present in the script but is commented out during the `gcloud run deploy` command. It is typically used for specifying custom audiences for authenticated access. If you remove `--allow-unauthenticated` and enable authentication, this would be used to define valid audiences for ID tokens.
    * **Example:** `export CUSTOM_AUDIENCE="https://my-service.com"` (Currently not actively used by the script's current configuration)

**Load Balancer Component Variables (Generated/Derived, no manual export needed unless you override defaults):**

The following variables are derived or have default names based on your `SERVICENAME` and `IP_NAME`. You generally don't need to set these explicitly unless you want to customize them.

* `IP_NAME`: Name for the Global Static IP Address.
* `CERT_NAME`: Name for the Managed SSL Certificate.
* `NEG_NAME`: Name for the Serverless NEG.
* `BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME`: Name for the Backend Service.
* `URL_MAP_NAME`: Name for the URL Map.
* `TARGET_PROXY_NAME`: Name for the Target HTTPS Proxy.
* `FORWARDING_RULE_NAME`: Name for the Global HTTPS Forwarding Rule.
* `CUSTOM_DOMAIN`: This is dynamically set to `IP.nip.io` within the script for testing purposes. If you wish to use your own custom domain, you would need to:
    1.  Uncomment `export CUSTOM_DOMAIN="your.custom.domain.com"` in the script.
    2.  Replace `"your.custom.domain.com"` with your actual domain.
    3.  Ensure you have DNS records configured to point your domain to the provisioned Load Balancer IP address.

## How it Works

The script performs the following steps:

1.  **Prerequisites Checks:** Verifies that essential variables are set and `gcloud` is configured.
2.  **Cloud Run Deployment:**
    * Clones the official `grpc/grpc` repository (if not already present).
    * Navigates to the `examples/python/helloworld` directory.
    * Creates a `Procfile` to define the service entrypoint (`web: python3 greeter_server.py`).
    * Creates a `requirements.txt` file for Python dependencies (`grpcio`, `protobuf`).
    * Deploys the gRPC service to Google Cloud Run as an **unauthenticated** service on port `50051` with a `3600` second timeout.
3.  **Global HTTPS Load Balancer Configuration:**
    * **Global Static IP:** Creates a new global static IP address for the Load Balancer.
    * **TLS Certificate:** Creates a Google-managed SSL certificate for the dynamically generated `IP.nip.io` domain.
    * **Serverless NEG:** Creates a Serverless Network Endpoint Group (NEG) specifically for the deployed Cloud Run service.
    * **Backend Service:** Creates a Global External Backend Service (with `load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL_MANAGED`) and attaches the Serverless NEG to it. **Note:** The backend service will automatically configure itself for HTTPS / HTTP/2 when a Serverless NEG is attached.
    * **URL Map:** Creates a URL map to direct all incoming traffic to the backend service.
    * **Target HTTPS Proxy:** Creates a Target HTTPS Proxy, which uses the SSL certificate and the URL map.
    * **Global Forwarding Rule:** Creates a Global HTTPS Forwarding Rule that binds the static IP address to the Target HTTPS Proxy on port `443`.

## How to Run

1.  **Save the script:** Save the provided script content as a file, for example, `deploy_grpc_lb.sh`.
2.  **Make it executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x deploy_grpc_lb.sh
    ```
3.  **Set environment variables:** Configure the required environment variables as described in [Required Environment Variables (Exports)](#required-environment-variables-exports). You can do this directly in your shell or by editing the script's `export` lines.
    ```bash
    export PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
    export REGION="your-gcp-region"
    export SERVICENAME="your-service-name"
    export pythonfilename="greeter_server.py" # Or your specific filename
    export SA_NAME="your-impersonation-sa-name"
    export CUSTOM_AUDIENCE="your-custom-audience" 
    ```
4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./deploy_grpc_lb.sh
    ```
The script will print progress messages and final output.

## Outputs

Upon successful completion, the script will display:

* The deployed Cloud Run Service URL.
* The Global Load Balancer's external IP address (HTTPS).
* Instructions to point your custom domain (or the `nip.io` domain) to this IP address.
* Important notes about DNS propagation and SSL certificate provisioning time.

## Testing the gRPC Service

Once the Load Balancer is fully provisioned (which can take several minutes for the SSL certificate to become active), you can test your gRPC service using `grpcurl`.

1.  **Install `grpcurl`:** If you don't have it, follow the instructions on the `grpcurl` GitHub repository.
2.  **Navigate to the proto file:** Ensure you are in a directory where `helloworld.proto` is accessible. The script clones the `grpc-backend` repository. The proto file is located at `grpc-backend/examples/protos/helloworld.proto`.
3.  **Use the Load Balancer IP/Domain:** Use the `FORWARDING_RULE_IP` (or `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` once DNS is propagated) from the script's output.

    ```bash
    # Example assuming you are in the script's base directory
    LB_IP=$(gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe "$FORWARDING_RULE_NAME" --global --format="get(IPAddress)" --project="$PROJECT_ID")
    LB_DOMAIN="$LB_IP.nip.io" # Or your CUSTOM_DOMAIN if you set it manually
    TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token --impersonate-service-account=<SA used in the script or SA which has cloud run Invoker access>)
    
    Note: Replace <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_OR_ID> with the email of a service account that has the necessary roles/run.invoker (Cloud Run Invoker) permission for your Cloud Run service, or with the service account used in the script (${SA_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com) if it has been granted roles/run.invoker. The user running this gcloud command must have roles/iam.serviceAccountUser on the service account being impersonated.


    grpcurl -import-path grpc-backend/examples/protos \
            -proto helloworld.proto \
            -H "Authorization":"Bearer $TOKEN"
            "$LB_DOMAIN:443" \
            helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
    ```
    This command should return a response like:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Hello, you!"
    }
    ```
    (Replace `"you"` with the actual name if your `SayHello` method takes an argument, or ensure the input message is correctly formatted for your specific gRPC method.)

## Cleanup

To remove all the resources created by this script, run the following commands in order:

```bash
gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete $FORWARDING_RULE_NAME --global --quiet --project=$PROJECT_ID
gcloud compute target-https-proxies delete $TARGET_PROXY_NAME --global --quiet --project=$PROJECT_ID
gcloud compute url-maps delete $URL_MAP_NAME --global --quiet --project=$PROJECT_ID
gcloud compute backend-services delete $BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME --global --quiet --project=$PROJECT_ID
gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups delete $NEG_NAME --region="$REGION" --quiet --project=$PROJECT_ID
gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete $CERT_NAME --global --quiet --project=$PROJECT_ID
gcloud compute addresses delete $IP_NAME --global --quiet --project=$PROJECT_ID
gcloud run services delete $SERVICENAME --region=$REGION --quiet --project=$PROJECT_ID
rm -rf grpc-backend # Deletes the cloned repository
```
**Note:** Allow a few minutes for resources to fully de-provision before attempting recreation if you encounter conflicts.

## Important Notes

### IAM Permissions

The user or service account executing this script (or the service account used for impersonation, if applicable) must have the necessary IAM permissions. Recommended roles include:

* `roles/run.admin`: To deploy and manage Cloud Run services.
* `roles/compute.admin`: To create and manage Load Balancers, NEGs, IP addresses, certificates, etc. This grants broad Compute Engine permissions.
* `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`: If you are using service account impersonation (as indicated by `--impersonate-service-account`), the user running the script needs this role on the service account being impersonated.
* `roles/compute.networkAdmin`: For network-related configurations.
* `roles/servicenetworking.serviceAgent`: This role is sometimes needed for service networking.

For production environments, always apply the principle of least privilege and grant only the specific permissions required.

### Security and Authentication

* **`--allow-unauthenticated`:** The Cloud Run service is deployed with this flag, making it publicly accessible. This is suitable for demos and external-facing APIs that don't require user authentication.

### gRPC Protocol (HTTP/2)

The Load Balancer is configured to work with gRPC by using the `EXTERNAL_MANAGED` load balancing scheme and an implicit support for HTTP/2 when connecting to Serverless NEGs. This allows your gRPC client to connect to the Load Balancer's HTTPS frontend and communicate over HTTP/2.

### DNS Propagation and SSL Certificate Provisioning

After the script completes, it can take several minutes (sometimes up to 15-30 minutes or more) for:

* DNS changes (if using your own domain and pointing it to the LB IP) to propagate.
* The Google-managed SSL certificate to be fully provisioned and become active.

During this time, you might experience connection errors or certificate warnings when trying to access the Load Balancer's IP/domain.

### Service Account Impersonation

The script uses `--impersonate-service-account="$SERVICE_ACCOUNT"` when creating the global static IP address. This means the `gcloud` command will be executed as if it were performed by the specified service account (`${SA_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
The user running the script must have the `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` permission on this service account, and the service account itself must have the necessary permissions (e.g., `roles/compute.admin`) to create the IP address.
